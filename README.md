# Recipes

*This repository is work product from Udacity's "****[How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)****" course. In this exercise, I forked [LarryMad](https://github.com/LarryMad)'s recipes repository, collaborated with [Sarah Spikes](https://github.com/salogel42) on a cake recipe, made a pull request, updated a pull request to deal with conflicting changes, and merged a pull request.*

This repository contains recipes for some foods I like.
